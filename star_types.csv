"Type","Description"
"O","O-type stars are very hot, blue, and extremely luminous, with most of
their radiated output in the ultraviolet range. In the main sequence, their
masses are at least 16 times the mass of our sun. These are the rarest of all
main-sequence stars. About 1 in 3,000,000 (0.00003%) of the main-sequence
stars in the solar neighborhood are O-type stars. Some of the most massive
stars lie within this spectral class. O-type stars frequently have complicated
surroundings that make measurement of their spectra difficult. Because they
are so massive, O-type stars have very hot cores and burn through their
hydrogen fuel very quickly, so they are the first stars to leave the main
sequence."
"B","B-type stars are very luminous and blue. They make up approximately 0.12%
of all main-sequence stars. In the main sequence, their masses range from 2.1
to 16 times the mass of our sun. Their spectra have neutral helium lines,
which are most prominent at the B2 subclass, and moderate hydrogen lines. As
O- and B-type stars are so energetic, they only live for a relatively short
time. Thus, due to the low probability of kinematic interaction during their
lifetime, they are unable to stray far from the area in which they formed,
apart from runaway stars."
"A","A-type stars are among the more common naked eye stars, and are white or
bluish-white. About 0.61% of main-sequence stars are type A. In the main
sequence, their masses range from 1.4 to 2.1 times the mass of our sun."
"F","F-type stars are white in color, with main-sequence mass ranging from
1.04 to 1.4 times the mass of our sun.  About 1 in 33 (3.03%) of the
main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are F-type stars."
"G","G-type stars include the Sun, and their color is classified as yellow.
Class G main-sequence stars make up about 7.5%, nearly one in thirteen, of the
main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood.  There are 21 G-type stars
within 10 parsecs. In the main sequence, their masses range from 0.8 to 1.04
times the mass of our sun.  Class G contains the 'Yellow Evolutionary Void.'
Supergiant stars often swing between O or B (blue) and K or M (red). While
they do this, they do not stay for long in the unstable yellow supergiant
class."
"K","K-type stars are orangish stars that are slightly cooler than the Sun.
They make up about 12% of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood.
Their main-sequence masses range from 0.45 to 0.8 times the mass of our sun.
There are also giant K-type stars, which range from hypergiants like RW
Cephei, to giants and supergiants, such as Arcturus, whereas orange dwarfs,
like Alpha Centauri B, are main-sequence stars."
"M","Class M stars are by far the most common. About 76% of the main-sequence
stars in the solar neighborhood are class M stars. However, class M
main-sequence stars (red dwarfs) have such low luminosities that none are
bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye, unless under exceptional
conditions. The brightest-known M class main-sequence star is Lacaille 8760,
class M0V, with magnitude 6.7 (the limiting magnitude for typical naked-eye
visibility under good conditions being typically quoted as 6.5), and it is
extremely unlikely that any brighter examples will be found. Masses of
main-sequence type-M stars range from 0.08 to 0.45 times the mass of our sun.
Although most class M stars are red dwarfs, most of the largest-known
supergiant stars in the Milky Way are class M stars, such as VY Canis Majoris,
VV Cephei, Antares, and Betelgeuse. Furthermore, some larger, hotter brown
dwarfs are late class M."
